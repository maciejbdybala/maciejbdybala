# About me

Hi! My name is Maciej Dybala, I currently work as an assistant statistician for the Scottish Government. Otherwise:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting firmly established as a data worker. At work, I build and maintain [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/gov-uk-rap-materials) using SQL and R. I also build and maintaining dashboards in Power BI (using DAX and M).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bunch of things. Amongst others, this is my attempt to learn navigating Git and GitHub seamlessly. I put a lot of thought in improving my [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/gov-uk-rap-materials) and think of complementing SQL and R with Python + advancing my work on dashboards in Power BI (using DAX and M). Besides that, I am also the [ONS Data Science Graduate Programme](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/long-read/data-science-graduate-programme/) participant where I learn a ton on Data Science. Separately, I am doing an OU module called Computational Applied Mathematics - [MST374 course](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/mst374). This is a new module and it is done in Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the above projects. Whilst I am good at logical reasoning with fairly recent First Honours Degree in BSc Mathematics and Statistics from the Open University, I also hold degrees in Psychology and Political Science and have a lot of experience of working in social setting which makes me a skilled people person.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with guidance on how to get to the roles revolving around being a data worker. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I am happy to have a chat on most subjects.
